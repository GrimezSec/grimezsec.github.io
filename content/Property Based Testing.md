Property-based testing is a testing approach where you test the properties of your code with many random inputs, rather than specifying individual test cases with expected outputs. This technique originates from the Haskell library QuickCheck and has been adapted for various programming languages.

### Key Concepts of Property-Based Testing:

1. **Randomized Inputs**: Instead of hand-crafting specific inputs, property-based tests generate random inputs. This can uncover edge cases that manual tests might miss.

2. **Testing Properties**: Instead of testing for specific expected results, property-based tests verify certain properties or invariants of the code. A property is a statement like "for all inputs x, y, and z, condition C holds true".

3. **Automated Case Generation**: The testing framework automatically generates a wide range of inputs, including edge cases, to thoroughly test the code against the defined properties.

4. **Shrinking**: When a test fails, the testing framework tries to "shrink" the failing test case to the simplest possible input that still causes a failure. This makes debugging easier.

### Advantages:

- **Covers More Cases**: Random input generation can cover a broader range of inputs than manually specified test cases.
- **Finds Edge Cases**: It's effective in finding edge cases and bugs that developers might not have thought to test.
- **Expressive**: Properties can be more expressive and cover a broader range of scenarios than specific test cases.

### Disadvantages:

- **Complexity**: Writing good property tests can be more complex than writing traditional unit tests.
- **Interpretation**: When a test fails, understanding why can be more challenging, especially if the failing input is complex or unintuitive.
- **Coverage**: It's not always clear how thorough the random input generation is, or whether it covers all important cases.

### Example Usage:

In a language like Python, you might use a library like Hypothesis for property-based testing. For instance, testing a sorting function might involve the property "for any list of integers, the function should return a list with the same elements in ascending order". The testing framework would then generate random lists of integers, pass them to the function, and check if the output satisfies this property.

Property-based testing is particularly useful in scenarios where the input domain is large or complex and where it's challenging to think of all possible cases. However, it's generally used in conjunction with, rather than as a replacement for, traditional example-based tests.
