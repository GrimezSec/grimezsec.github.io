DevSecOps architecture design is  divided into 10 phases.

DevSecOps architecture is
designed to meet the international leading cloud native security
4C model (CNCF standard: cloud, cluster, container, code) and
security development life cycle (Microsoft standard) evaluation
system, across the two areas of R&D performance and security,
security is introduced into every stage of the R&D process
(DORA Level 5 standard: Integrate security in the
requirements, design, build, test, and deployment phases).
