# AkÄ±n's Second Brain ðŸ§ 

Welcome to my public Second Brain! This is a space where I store my notes, ideas, insights, and connections Iâ€™ve made throughout my life. Organized as a Zettelkasten (or a Digital Garden), you can explore the various topics that interest me, learn from the content Iâ€™ve gathered, and see how everything is connected.

There are multiple ways to navigate my Second Brain:

* Use the search bar on the top right or press cmd+k (ctrl+k on Windows) or click on the Search button (top right) to search for any term.
* Click on a note to explore its content, and follow the links and backlinks to dive deeper into related topics.
* Interact with the graph at the right of the page to visualize connections between notes and click on any node to navigate directly to that note.



# Map of Content (MOC)
My Second Brain is continuously growing, and while I have some essential Map of Content (MOC) starting points listed below, there are many more topics to discover as you explore. Feel free to dive into any of the following areas:
