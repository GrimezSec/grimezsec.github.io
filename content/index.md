# AkÄ±n "Grimez"'s Second Brain ðŸ§ 

Welcome to my public Second Brain! This is a space where I store my notes, ideas, insights, and connections Iâ€™ve made throughout my life. Organized as a Zettelkasten (or a Digital Garden), you can explore the various topics that interest me, learn from the content Iâ€™ve gathered, and see how everything is connected.

There are multiple ways to navigate my Second Brain:

* Use the search bar on the top right or press cmd+k (ctrl+k on Windows) or click on the Search button (top right) to search for any term.
* Click on a note to explore its content, and follow the links and backlinks to dive deeper into related topics.
* Interact with the graph at the right of the page to visualize connections between notes and click on any node to navigate directly to that note.
